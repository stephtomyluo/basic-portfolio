                <p>Hi! My name is Stephanie and I am looking to make a career change from HR into IT. I own many animals; 2 french bulldogs, 1 pug, 1 bengal cat, many ball pythons, 1 carpet python, and a super dwarf reticulated python. Outside of working fulltime, going to school fulltime, and essentially living in a zoo, I go to heels classes, love to eat, and collect manga.</p>

                <p>I currently attend the KU Coding Bootcamp in the FullStack Flex. Outside of class, I attend a variety of networking events, such as Coding & Cocktails, ngGirls, and Centriq hosted events. I am looking forward to building my knowledge and starting my journey and career as a developer!</p>
